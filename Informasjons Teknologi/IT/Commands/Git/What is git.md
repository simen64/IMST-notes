Picture you and your friends are building a website together. One person’s working on the homepage, another’s editing the CSS, someone else is fixing bugs.  
If you all just sent each other your new files over Discord or Google Drive... it’d turn into _total chaos_.  
People overwrite each other’s work, someone deletes something by accident, no one knows which version is newest — nightmare.

That’s where **Git** comes in.

Git is a **version control system**, aka a program that keeps track of all changes to your files and lets multiple people work on the same project _without stepping on each other’s toes_.

It’s like Google Docs **but for code** — everyone can work on it at the same time, and Git keeps track of every change.
   
You can always **go back in time** to any previous version of your project.

You can **branch off** to test new ideas safely, and **merge** them back when they work.
   
It’s usually used with **GitHub** which is a online place where the Git project is stored and shared.
