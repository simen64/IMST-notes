Wireshark is a **network protocol analyzer** — basically a microscope for network traffic.  
It lets you **capture and inspect data packets** in real time, showing what’s being sent and received over your network.
Think of it like this:  
If your internet connection was a conversation, Wireshark is you putting on noise-canceling headphones and listening _only_ to the words spoken — seeing every single “hello,” “ACK,” and “GET /index.html.”

**What Wireshark can do**
- **Capture live traffic** from your network interfaces (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, USB, etc.)

- **Analyze packets** by protocol (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, etc.)

- **Filter** to find specific conversations or suspicious activity

- **Inspect payloads** — see what data’s actually inside

- **Debug and troubleshoot** network problems
    
- **Learn how protocols really work** (super useful for IT/security students)
