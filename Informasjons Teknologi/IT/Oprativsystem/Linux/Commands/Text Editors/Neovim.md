**Neovim** (`nvim`) is an advanced, modern version of **[[vim]]**.

Built to fix Vim's old crusty limitations:

- Async plugins (smooth LSP, autocomplete, formatting)
    
- Lua config (instead of Vimscript)
    
- Better terminal UI
    
- Cleaner codebase
    

Think: _Vim on Creatine + ADHD meds + GPU shaders._

**How to install**

Debian / Ubuntu

	sudo apt install neovim

Arch / Arch Based

	sudo pacman -S neovim

Fedora 

	sudo dnf install neovim

macOS

	brew install neovim


The keybinds is the same as for [[vim]]
